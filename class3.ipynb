    "# **Functions In Python**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Functions are one of the most important parts of Python — they help you reuse code, keep your program organized, and make it easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a **function** ?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. You define it once and use (call) it whenever needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Example of function.`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think of a function like a blender. You put in fruits (inputs), press the button (call the function), and get a smoothie (output).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Function Definition and Declaration.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, **defining** and **declaring** a function happens in the same step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To define a function in Python, use the `def` keyword followed by `function_name` and `paranthesis()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Parts of function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `function_name`: It is the name you choose for the function like add(), average(), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `parameters`: They are optional — they receive input values\n",
    "\n",
    "- `body of function` : The body is indented (4 spaces or 1 tab)\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Arguments (Inputs to a Function)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can send values to a function through parameters (variables inside the function) and arguments (actual values you send when calling it).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of **Arguments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `positional arguments` : Positional arguments are values you pass to a function in the exact order that the function's parameters are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **key rule** : The position (order) of the arguments must match the order of the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `default arguments` : You can set a default value for a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Keyword Arguments` : You can pass arguments **by their actual name**, in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ` Variable-Length Arguments` : Sometimes, you don’t know in advance how many values a function will receive. Python allows you to write functions that accept:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Any number of **positional arguments** using `*args`. They are stored as a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Any number of **keyword arguments** using `**kwargs`.They are stored as a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `return` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **return** statement is used to **send a result back from a function to the place where the function was called**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Without `return`, your function will do something, but it won’t give you back any result to use later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working of **return** statement :\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can **return** any data type: number, string, list, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can **return** multiple values (Python packs them into a tuple), and give you one by one in sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As soon as **return** is hit, the function stops and goes back to the caller.No code execute after **return**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you don't use return, Python will return None by default.\n"
